# CurvatureAndTorsion

This repo is part of the Supplementary information for the paper "Reconstruction of the three-dimensional beat pattern underlying swimming behaviors of sperm (Gong, et. al. 2021)".

The Matlab code of "CurvatureAndTorsion5.m" is an example of using the "Frenet Robust" algorithm to calculate 3D filaments' curvature and torsion. For running this code, you need download the frenet_robust function from here:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47885-frenet_robust-zip. The latest version of this function is also included in the following data package.

The sperm flagellar dataset can be download through following zenodo link:
