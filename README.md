# CurvatureAndTorsion

This repo is part of the Supplementary information for the paper "Reconstruction of the three-dimensional beat pattern underlying swimming behaviors of sperm (Gong, et. al. 2021)".
The Matlab code of "CurvatureAndTorsion5.m" is an example of using the "Frenet Robust" algorithm to calculate 3D filaments' curvature and torsion.

The sperm flagellar dataset can be download through following zenodo link:
