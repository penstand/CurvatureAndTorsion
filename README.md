# CurvatureAndTorsion

This repo is part of the Supplementary Information for the paper "Reconstruction of the three-dimensional beat pattern underlying swimming behaviors of sperm (Gong, et. al. 2021)".

The Matlab code of "CurvatureAndTorsion5.m" is an example of using the "Frenet Robust" algorithm to calculate 3D filaments' curvature and torsion. For running this code, you need to download the frenet_robust function from here:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47885-frenet_robust-zip. The latest version (ver.7) of this function is also includeded in the following data package.

The sperm flagellar dataset can be download through the following zenodo link:
